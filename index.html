    <h3>GERMANY</h3>
    <hr />
    <p class="text"> Having resided in Germany for the past three years, I seized a remarkable opportunity to volunteer
        as a tour guide, which gave me a chance to visit some of the nation‚Äôs most captivating cities. Leading a group
        amidst cobblestone
        streets and centuries-old architecture, I grappled with the task of remembering quite a lot of historical facts.
        The effort was formidable, yet undeniably rewarding.</p>

    <p class="text"> As I look ahead to 2024, I am poised to embark on a new chapter: a two-year vocational training
        course as a
        software
        developer. This website was built as my first HTML and CSS project.
        I invite you to peruse a curated collection of photographs‚Äîmoments frozen in time,
        captured during my travels, serving as a testament to the beauty and allure of the places I hold dear.<br />
